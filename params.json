{"name":"BFF","tagline":"Your first line of defence against brute force attacks.","body":"BFF is your first line of defence against brute force attacks.  It has been designed with a focus on low resource usage and high concurrency.  It’s open source and has simple APIs for several common languages.\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\nThe core of the system is a lightweight application that tracks repeated requests for usernames, passwords and any other type of data that can be tracked in a request (such as the attacker’s IP address).  You’re notified anytime you receive a request that appears to be an attack.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note that BFF only tells you **which** requests look like attacks and not **what** to do about it.  For more information on how to deal with brute force attacks, [see here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nBFF is designed to be as flexible as possible by imposing as few requirements as possible.  Unless you compile from source, there are no dependencies to run BFF.\r\n\r\n### Binaries\r\n\r\nThere are binaries available for download for 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X and Windows on the [release page](https://github.com/JamesOwenHall/BruteForceProtection/releases).  For other operating systems or architectures, you’ll need to build from source.\r\n\r\n### From Source\r\n\r\nTo build BFF from source, you’ll need to have the [Go compiler](http://golang.org) and GCC.  Once you have those, simply run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake DEST_DIR=/usr/local/bff\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will build the system and output the binaries to the `/usr/local/bff` directory.  It's also recommended that you add `/usr/local/bff/bin` to your PATH variable.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/JamesOwenHall/bfp/wiki/Getting-Started).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
